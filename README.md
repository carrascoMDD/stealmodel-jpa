# stealmodel_jpa

stealmodel-jpa, when injected into Java/Spring/JPA application, allows to "steal" the JPA annotations from entity and related classes. The exported annotations may be used as the starting point to drive provisioning of an application through some RAD.

Model Driven approaches to automated software provisioning are able to deliver a running application from specifications complete and precise enough. 
For Rapid Application Development (RAD) toolsets, models are "materials" which a RAD toolset may massage to deliver an application.
Therefore, there is value for RAD users in "stealing" a model which is specific to a given RAD, such that it may be transformed and injected in a different RAD.
